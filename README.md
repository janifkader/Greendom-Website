# Greendom
Greendom is a website which can check the recyclability of any item that the user searches for. The user is even able to add an item themselves. The website was developed with HTML and CSS with PHP and SQL on the backend to handle the database which stores all of the recyclability information. The website is currently locally hosted through XAMPP.
