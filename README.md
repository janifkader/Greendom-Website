# Greendom
Greendom is a website which can check the recyclability of any item that the user searches for. The user is even able to add an item themselves. The website was developed with HTML and CSS with PHP and PostgreSQL on the backend to handle the database which stores all of the recyclability information. The website is currently hosted through Render and can be accessed with the following [link](https://greendom-website.onrender.com).
